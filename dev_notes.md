# Development Notes

## Current Product Direction

The application is a functional prototype for evaluating rental locations by nearby everyday amenities. The near-term priority is a working MVP over production infrastructure, accounts, saved searches, or advanced scoring inputs.

The UI direction is now amenities-first. Overall score and category scores are intentionally compact summary elements, while nearby amenities, the map, and additional location indicators carry the main result detail. This keeps the interface closer to a decision dashboard than a score report.

## Full-Stack Status

The project can be described as a full-stack Next.js prototype because it includes:

* a React/Next.js frontend
* server-side route handlers under `app/api/*`
* API integrations with Google Places, Google Geocoding, Google Maps, and optional Transitland
* backend business logic for category retrieval, filtering, deduplication, scoring, and transport enrichment
* environment-based server and browser API key configuration

It should not yet be described as a production full-stack platform. The backend layer is request/response API orchestration rather than a persistent application backend.

Missing production-grade full-stack pieces:

* **Backend operations:** no rate limiting, background jobs, observability, structured logging, or error tracking. Request caching now exists via the database snapshot cache.
* **Admin/data management:** category weights and brand lists are code-managed; there is no admin UI or config storage.
* **First-party datasets:** rent trends, crime/safety, schools, childcare, population density, and planning/development signals are placeholders until dedicated sources are integrated.

## Persistence and Caching

Database persistence was added with Prisma 6, initially on SQLite and later switched to hosted Postgres (Neon, Sydney region) for deployment — Vercel's serverless platform has no persistent filesystem for an SQLite file. The provider switch changed only `schema.prisma` and `DATABASE_URL`; no query code changed. The SQLite-dialect migration history was regenerated as a single Postgres init migration, since the cloud database started empty. Local dev now talks to the same Neon database. Prisma 7 was intentionally avoided for now because it requires a driver-adapter setup; upgrade later with the official guide if needed.

Deployment pipeline: `postinstall` runs `prisma generate` (Vercel builds start from a clean machine) and the build script runs `prisma migrate deploy` before `next build`, so schema changes pushed to GitHub are applied to the production database automatically on deploy.

The app is deployed at https://rent-score-prototype.vercel.app/ (Vercel, auto-deploys on push to main). Environment variables are configured in the Vercel dashboard — paste bare values there, no quotes (a quoted `DATABASE_URL` failed the first deploy with P1012). The browser Maps key is referrer-restricted to localhost and the vercel.app domains and API-restricted to Maps JavaScript API; the server key has no referrer restriction (server calls send none) and is API-restricted to Places API (New) and Geocoding API.

Environments are separated with Neon branches: local dev uses the `development` branch (its connection string in local `.env`), production uses the default branch (its string in Vercel). The branch was forked copy-on-write from production with data and migration history included, so `migrate status` was already in sync. Day-to-day flow: schema changes run `prisma migrate dev` locally against the development branch; on push, Vercel's build runs `prisma migrate deploy` against production. Destructive maintenance (clearing snapshots on scoring changes) now only touches the dev branch — production needs its own deliberate pass when a scoring change ships, or stale scores simply age out via re-searches.

Two tables in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

* **SearchLocation:** one row per searched location. `cacheKey` is the lat/lng rounded to 4 decimal places (~11 m), so repeat searches of the same spot reuse the row even if geocoding jitters.
* **ScoreSnapshot:** one row per computed result, holding `overallScore` plus the full category scores and place groups as JSON strings (SQLite has no native JSON column in Prisma). Multiple snapshots per location preserve history.

Flow in `/api/places`: look up the newest snapshot for the cache key; if it is younger than 24 hours, return it with `cached: true` and skip all Google calls. Otherwise fetch from Google, score, save a new snapshot, and return `cached: false`. Database errors are caught and logged so a broken database degrades to a normal Google lookup instead of failing the search.

Supporting pieces:

* `app/lib/db.ts` — PrismaClient singleton guarded against dev hot-reload connection leaks.
* `app/lib/services/searchStore.ts` — cache key builder, snapshot lookup/save, recent-search and saved-location listing, and save/unsave.
* `/api/history` — returns recent searches ordered by `lastSearchedAt`.
* `RecentSearches` component — chips under the search form; clicking one re-runs the search from stored coordinates without geocoding. The recent row filters out locations that are already saved, so a location never appears as two chips at once.
* Cache status is folded into the existing badge next to the "Category scores" heading ("Cached result" vs "Live nearby data", with a hover tooltip for the full explanation) instead of a standalone sentence in the layout.
* The green geocode confirmation box under the search form was removed: the matched address is visible in the input and the chips, and coordinates are not user-relevant.

## Saved Locations

Users can star any recent search to keep it permanently. Implementation:

* `SearchLocation.savedAt DateTime?` — null means not saved; a timestamp doubles as the save date and the sort key for the saved list. Same pattern as soft-delete `deletedAt` columns.
* `/api/favourites` — REST verbs on one route: GET lists saved locations, POST (`{ locationId }`) saves, DELETE (`?id=`) unsaves. Input is validated at the route boundary: missing/invalid ids answer 400, unknown ids answer 404 (Prisma error `P2025` is caught in `setLocationSaved` and mapped to `false`).
* `RecentSearches` renders both a "Saved locations" and a "Recent searches" chip row. Each chip is a div with two sibling buttons (address re-runs the search, star toggles saving) because HTML forbids nesting buttons. After a toggle the component refetches both lists instead of hand-editing local state, keeping the database the single source of truth.

This completes CRUD coverage over the persistence layer (create/read via search caching, update via save toggling; snapshot deletion is still only via cascade).

Saved locations are independent of snapshot state: listings no longer require a snapshot to exist, so clearing `ScoreSnapshot` (done on scoring-algorithm changes) never makes favourites vanish — they show without a score badge until re-searched, and the compare panel offers only the ones that have scores. Stars (`savedAt`) are never deleted by any time-based process; the 24-hour TTL only decides when Google is re-queried.

### Why these choices

* **Nullable timestamp instead of a boolean `isSaved`.** One column carries two facts — whether it is saved and when — so the saved list can sort by save date without another column and another migration. Timestamps-as-state is a widely used pattern (`deletedAt`, `verifiedAt`, `publishedAt`).
* **Validation lives at the API boundary, not in the service layer.** The route is the front door: everything past it can assume clean input, so `searchStore` stays free of defensive checks and is easier to read and test. Error codes are deliberately split — 400 means "your request is malformed", 404 means "well-formed but no such row", 500 means "our bug" — because callers debug very different problems depending on which one they get.
* **Refetch after every mutation instead of hand-editing component state.** The database is the single source of truth; the UI is a mirror of it (`UI = f(data)`). Hand-edited local state can drift — e.g. a star lights up even though the request failed, or two open tabs disagree. The cost is one extra GET per toggle, which is trivial for a prototype and removes a whole class of sync bugs.
* **Route handlers only translate HTTP; `searchStore` owns all Prisma calls.** Swapping SQLite for Postgres, adding caching, or writing tests touches one file instead of every route. This is the same layering as Controller → Service → Repository in Spring-style backends.
* **One component owns both chip rows.** Saved and Recent refresh at exactly the same moments (page load, search completion, star toggle); a single fetch effect guarantees they can never fall out of sync with each other.

`DATABASE_URL` lives in `.env` (Prisma CLI reads `.env`, not `.env.local`). An older unfinished persistence attempt had left a PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` and an empty migration folder; both were cleaned up because `.env.local` overrides `.env` in Next.js and was breaking the SQLite connection.

## Comparison View

Two saved locations can be compared side by side. Implementation:

* `/api/compare?a=id1&b=id2` — GET with query params (a read-only endpoint, so the whole comparison is shareable as a URL). Both snapshot lookups run through `Promise.all` so total latency is the slower query, not the sum. Missing/equal ids answer 400, unknown ids 404.
* `getComparisonSide` in `searchStore` returns a location plus its latest snapshot with the full `CategoryScore[]` parsed back out of `scoresJson` — the read-side twin of the `JSON.stringify` done at save time.
* `ComparePanel` renders two controlled selects over the saved list and fetches automatically once both sides are chosen. The higher score per row is highlighted. It renders nothing until at least two locations are saved.
* The panel lives in the right column between the map and additional indicators (it originally sat below the amenities list, which buried it several screens down and left the right column empty). Its selects stack vertically and its card styling matches the other right-column cards.

### Why these choices

* **State lifted into `useSavedSearches`.** The chips and the comparison panel both need the saved list; if each fetched its own copy they would drift apart after a star toggle. The hook owns one copy in `page.tsx` and both components receive it as props — `RecentSearches` became purely presentational in the process.
* **No new database columns or Google calls.** Comparison is a pure read over existing snapshots — the payoff of persisting results in week one.
* **Stale selections are derived away, not synced away.** If a location is unstarred while selected in a dropdown, the component does not fix the state in an effect (the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint rule forbids it because it causes a cascading second render). Instead the effective selection is derived on every render: an id no longer present in the saved list simply counts as "nothing selected". Rule of thumb: if a value can be computed from existing state/props, compute it during render instead of storing and synchronising it.

Recommended next full-stack milestone: deploy to Vercel with a hosted Postgres (swap the Prisma datasource provider), since the core loop — search, score, save, compare — is now complete. Authentication remains the follow-up after that if multi-user support becomes a goal.

## Authentication

Accounts landed with Better Auth (email/password plus Google OAuth), chosen over Auth.js (its docs predate the Next 16 `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` rename and it discourages password auth) and Clerk (hosted; user data would live outside our database). Everything stays in the existing Neon Postgres through the Prisma adapter.

Pieces:

* `app/lib/auth.ts` — the server instance: password hashing (scrypt, stored in `account.password`), database sessions, and the Google token exchange. `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` signs session cookies; rotating it logs everyone out.
* `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` — one catch-all handler serves every auth endpoint (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, the Google callback at `/api/auth/callback/google`).
* `app/lib/auth-client.ts` — browser client; `useSession()` is reactive, so signing out re-renders every subscriber.
* `/login` — one page toggling between sign-in and sign-up (they share every field but name), plus "Continue with Google" which is a full-page redirect out and back.
* The CLI (`npx @better-auth/cli generate`) wrote four models into `schema.prisma`: `user`, `session`, `account` (one row per linked login method — a user can hold both a password and a Google account), `verification`.

Favourites became per-user via a `UserSavedLocation` join table (`userId`, `locationId`, `savedAt`, composite primary key). The old global `SearchLocation.savedAt` column was dropped — locations and snapshots stay a shared cache because a location's score does not depend on who asks; only the star is per-viewer. **Existing stars could not be migrated** — they had no owning user — so dev-branch stars were dropped with the column, and production will lose its stars the same way when this deploys.

Recent searches are per-account too, via a `UserSearch` join table (`userId`, `locationId`, `lastSearchedAt`, upserted so re-searching bumps instead of duplicating). Recents were briefly global after auth landed, which meant a fresh account saw strangers' searches — a privacy leak and confusing UX. Now `/api/places` records a `UserSearch` row for signed-in searchers (after `saveSnapshot`, so the location row exists; wrapped so a history-write failure never breaks the search), `listRecentSearches` reads only the viewer's rows, and signed-out visitors get an empty list. The chip shows when *this user* last searched a spot, not when anyone did. The shared `SearchLocation` cache is unchanged — an anonymous search still warms the snapshot cache for everyone; it just isn't attributed to anyone.

API boundary: all `/api/favourites` verbs resolve the session cookie first and answer **401** without one — a fourth error code alongside 400/404/500, meaning "we don't know who you are". `/api/history` stays public. `setLocationSaved` maps `P2003` (unknown location on save) and `P2025` (missing row on unsave) to 404; saving twice is an idempotent upsert.

UI: `AuthStatus` in the page header shows a sign-in link or email + sign-out; star buttons only render when signed in; `useSavedSearches` takes the viewer's user id as an effect dependency so login/logout refetches both lists, and a 401 from favourites renders as an empty saved list rather than a stale one.

Signed-out visitors get one sign-up prompt: a muted line under the search form — "Sign in to save locations, keep your recent searches, and compare rentals side by side." It renders in the exact spot the chips occupy after login, so the position itself communicates what appears there; that also covers compare without a second prompt in the panel. One prompt, not three, per the minimal-UI rule (it earns its place by carrying function discovery). Frontend-only change — the APIs already gate, this is discoverability.

Migration note: `prisma migrate dev` refuses non-interactive shells, so the migration was generated with `prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datasource --to-schema-datamodel --script` into a hand-named migration folder and applied with `prisma migrate deploy` — the same command the Vercel build runs.

### Stale-session bug after email login

Symptom: after signing out and signing back in with email/password, the first landing on the home page looked signed out (no email in the header, no star buttons) while the saved/recent lists still loaded — data that requires a valid session. A second sign-in "fixed" it.

Cause: the login page navigated with `router.push("/")` — a client-side navigation that keeps all in-memory JS state alive. `useSession`'s cached value had been set to null at sign-out, and the refresh it should get after sign-in raced the navigation, so the home page rendered against the stale null. The server saw the (valid) session cookie on every API call, hence the split-brain: server-fetched lists present, client-side session absent. Google login never had the bug because OAuth is a full-page redirect — everything reloads from scratch on return.

Fix: after successful email sign-in/up, navigate with `window.location.assign("/")` instead of `router.push`. A hard load refetches the session from zero, so no stale cache can survive — deliberately matching the redirect behaviour of the Google flow. Rule of thumb: after a whole-session state change (login, logout), prefer a full page load over SPA navigation; the lost smoothness is trivial next to a whole class of stale-state bugs.

Deployment checklist (not yet done): paste the real `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` into local `.env` (placeholders sit there now; email/password works without them), then add `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (a fresh one, not the dev value), `BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://rent-score-prototype.vercel.app`, and the Google pair to Vercel. Both redirect URIs (localhost and vercel.app) are already registered in the Google console.

## Category Configuration

Category metadata lives in `app/lib/categories.ts` instead of inside the Places API route. This keeps one source of truth for:

* category IDs and labels
* score weights
* UI colors
* branded search terms
* generic Google Places types

This avoids duplicating category labels, weights, or colors between the API, scoring logic, and UI.

Places should be assigned to one primary category only. Category order is also the dedupe priority:

1. Shopping Centres
2. Groceries
3. Food & Cafes
4. Transport
5. Health
6. Fitness
7. Fuel & Automotive
8. Services

This keeps mixed-use results such as fast food, fuel stations, convenience stores, and banks from appearing in multiple score buckets.

## Places Retrieval

The search bar uses a server-side autocomplete route backed by Google Places Autocomplete (New). Suggestions are restricted to Australia, keep the Google API key server-side, and feed the selected suggestion text into the existing geocoding flow.

The Places API route combines two kinds of results:

* Brand matches, such as Woolworths, Coles, Chemist Warehouse, Australia Post, or major gyms.
* Generic nearby places, such as supermarkets, cafes, restaurants, pharmacies, banks, post offices, fuel stations, and transit stations.

Brand results use Google Places Text Search because brand names are query text. Generic results use Google Places Nearby Search with included place types. Results are deduped by Google place ID, and a brand match is kept over a generic match when the same place appears in both result sets.

Category-level duplicate place IDs are filtered after retrieval using the category priority above. Shopping Centres use a 10 km search radius; the other MVP categories use the default 3 km radius.

Within each category, returned places are sorted for display by Google review count, then rating, then distance. Scoring still calculates closest distance from all places in the category, so popularity ordering does not weaken the proximity score.

Transport is the exception to the general category retrieval. It shows up to four nearest bus stops within 1 km, or the closest bus stops from a wider fallback search if none are found within 1 km. It also shows one nearest metro/train station from nearby rail station results, and one nearest V/Line station with no hard distance cutoff. Bus stops query both Google Places `bus_stop` and `bus_station` types so ordinary stop-level results are not missed.

When `TRANSITLAND_API_KEY` is configured, the transport lookup prefers Transitland bus stop data and enriches each returned bus stop with upcoming distinct route numbers, destinations, and departure times. Google Places remains the fallback for bus stops if Transitland is not configured or does not return nearby matches. V/Line classification is based on the local station list in `app/lib/vline-stations.txt`, which avoids relying on Google Places to label regional rail stations consistently. Transport rows do not show review counts because popularity is less useful for stops and stations.

## Search Criteria Refinements

To guarantee high-quality results, the API applies strict filtering:
* **Review Thresholds:** Any non-transport place returned from Google Places with fewer than 30 reviews is globally excluded from scoring and the UI.
* **Narrow Categories:** The Fuel & Automotive category strictly searches for `gas_station` and specific auto parts brands, intentionally filtering out minor local mechanics (`car_repair`). The Services category strictly searches for `post_office` and `bank`, dropping standalone ATMs.
* **Excluded primary types:** Google returns places whose *secondary* types match a search — hotels appeared in Fitness because they contain gyms, and stadiums appeared once the category expanded to sports types. Categories can list `excludedPrimaryTypes`; Fitness rejects hotel/lodging/club types plus spectator venues (`stadium`, `arena`, `event_venue`). Participatory venues (pools, rinks, fields) stay in.
* **Fitness & Recreation:** the fitness category covers gyms plus pools, sports complexes, and recreation centres (`fitness_center`, `swimming_pool`, `sports_complex`, `sports_club` types and Aquatic/Recreation/Leisure Centre + YMCA brand terms). Its `typicalRating` dropped from 4.7 to 4.5 because public pools and rec centres rate lower than boutique gyms.

## Scoring V3

Each category scores out of 100 across three pillars. V3 replaced V2's stepped tiers with continuous curves after real snapshots showed V2 compressing every location into 68–100 (a CBD and a new estate differed by only 9 overall points).

1. **Proximity (max 50):** full points within 400 m (genuinely walkable), then exponential decay with a half-life of 0.4 × the category search radius (1,200 m for standard 3 km categories, 4,000 m for 10 km shopping centres). No cliffs: 1,719 m and 1,721 m score essentially the same.
2. **Variety (max 30):** `30 × (1 − e^(−count/k))` with k = 6 for high-variety categories (Food & Cafes, Fitness) and k = 3 otherwise. Diminishing returns instead of a hard cap — the 10th cafe still adds something, so 25 cafes now outscore 12.
3. **Quality (max 20):** average rating of the top 3 rated places compared against the category's `typicalRating` baseline in `categories.ts` (banks ~3.3, stations ~3.8, gyms ~4.7): `10 + 12.5 × (avg − typical)`, clamped to 0–20. This cancels per-category review culture — a 4.1-rated bank is excellent for a bank, a 4.5 gym is ordinary. Places without ratings get the neutral midpoint 10, not free full marks.

Overall score remains a weighted average of category scores.

### Lifestyle profiles

The product is built for renters without a car, so `carFree` is the default profile and the canonical yardstick stored in snapshots (history chips and comparisons use it); `carOwner` is the alternative. A `balanced` middle profile existed briefly and was removed — two honest viewpoints beat three diluted ones. Profiles change two things, both defined in `categories.ts`:

* **Weights** (`weightProfiles`, each column sums to 100 so a weight reads as a percentage): carFree runs transport 28 / fuel 0 / services 3; carOwner runs fuel 14 / transport 8 / services 10. Fitness & Recreation is 10 in both — exercise habits do not correlate with car ownership.
* **Distance tolerance** (`proximityHalfLifeFactor`): the proximity pillar halves every factor × category-radius past the 400 m walkable ring — 0.25 car-free (distance hurts when you carry groceries onto a bus), 0.7 with a car. This makes *category scores themselves* shift with the profile, not just the weighted total; variety and quality stay profile-independent because how many places exist and how good they are does not depend on the viewer. Within the walkable ring the profiles agree by construction.

Calibration on Williams Landing (a drive-everywhere estate): groceries 58 car-free vs 76 car-owning, services 29 vs 47, food identical at 88 (73 m — walkable is walkable), overall 71 vs 77. Weights-only profiles had produced an inverted 75 vs 72 there; modelling distance tolerance flipped it to match intuition.

The API takes a `profile` query parameter and the UI exposes a segmented control (No car / Car owner) above the category scores. Switching profiles never calls Google: snapshots cache the raw place groups and scores are recomputed per request — cache the expensive, stable part; recompute the cheap, variable part. The category cards show each weight (zero-weight categories dim to "not counted") and sort by weight, so switching visibly reorders and relabels the grid.

Calibration was done by simulating the formulas against stored snapshots before implementation: Melbourne CBD 95→92, Hoppers Crossing 91→88, Williams Landing 86→72, widening the spread from 9 to 20 points and surfacing the new estate's real weaknesses (groceries/health at ~1.7 km, low-rated services). All constants (400 m ring, 0.4 half-life factor, k values, 12.5 slope, typical ratings) are first-pass values kept in one place for easy retuning; `typicalRating` is currently judgement-based and could later be derived from accumulated snapshot data.

Because scores live in cached snapshots, the `ScoreSnapshot` table was cleared when V3 shipped — mixing V2 and V3 numbers in history or comparisons would be misleading. Saved locations were unaffected and re-scored on next search.

Future scoring can add better walking-distance estimates, public transport frequency, school data, safety signals, and rental price context.

## Provider Choice

Google Maps and Google Places remain the primary providers for geocoding, place retrieval, and map rendering. Transitland is used only as optional transport enrichment because Google Places can identify bus stops but does not expose stop-level route numbers, destinations, or departures.

## Map Preview

The location preview uses the Google Maps JavaScript API through `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY`. The same underlying Google Cloud project can be used as the server key, but the browser-exposed key must be restricted by HTTP referrer.

The first map version shows:

* one primary marker for the searched location
* category-colored markers for nearby amenities
* slightly larger markers for brand matches
* marker popups with name, category, distance, and address

Nearby place latitude and longitude are included in the `/api/places` response so the map can render amenity markers without making extra client-side Places requests.

## Amenities-First UI

The main page layout is split into a wider left column and narrower right column:

* Left column: search, compact overall score, compact category scores, and nearby amenities.
* Right column: map preview and additional indicators.

`NearbyPlacesList` is now part of the primary result area rather than a side panel. It summarizes total places found and the nearest amenity, then displays each category as a dense card. Place rows are compact single lines (name, review summary, distance); the address and place type moved into a hover tooltip so low-priority detail stays available without costing rows. Each category shows three places by default with a "Show all N" toggle (progressive disclosure — expansion state is local per-category `useState`, since nothing else reads it). Bus-stop rows keep their route/departure sublines because that is core transport detail.

`ScoreBreakdown` remains compact and uses category score, count, and closest distance. Longer category explanations are deliberately omitted from the main UI for now so they do not compete with amenities.

## Minimal UI Pass

A restyle applied one test to every visual element: it must carry information or function, or it goes. Changes:

* Rainbow progress bars removed from category scores — with V3 scores clustering in a healthy range the bars all looked alike, so the number carries the message. A small colour dot next to each category name keeps the link to the matching map markers (the informational part of the colour survived; the decoration didn't).
* Amenity rows and indicator rows lost their per-row borders/backgrounds in favour of hairline dividers — one card level instead of three nested ones.
* Solid colour badges (indicator tones, "Planned" pills, bus route chips) became right-aligned muted text or grey chips; the five planned-data rows collapsed into one muted line. The tone-mapping helpers were deleted along with them — decoration usually drags supporting code with it.
* Headings unified to one size/weight across section cards; the uppercase eyebrow line above the H1 was dropped; the search button softened from black.
* Kept deliberately: map marker colours (functional), compare-table winner highlighting (information), the star toggle (function), and the single emerald overall-score accent.

## Additional Indicators

`AdditionalIndicators` renders below the map in the right column. It separates currently derived indicators from future dataset placeholders.

Currently derived indicators:

* **Walkability:** Uses straight-line distance estimates from current nearby place results. Walking time is estimated at 80 metres per minute. It shows the nearest bus stop/route, nearest major grocery, and nearest shopping centre as separate rows so long names can wrap.
* **Transit access:** Uses the transport category score, closest transport distance, and available Transitland departure counts when configured.
* **Amenity density:** Uses total nearby places across all current categories.
* **Daily convenience:** Averages groceries, food, health, services, and shopping category scores.
* **Car reliance:** Estimates whether core categories are beyond short walking range, with fuel/automotive availability providing a small offset.

Walkability grocery selection is intentionally restricted to major supermarket brands: Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, and IGA. Nearby grocery-like places such as specialty food stores are still useful in the amenities list and category scoring, but they are not used as the headline walkability grocery target.

The walkability badge color is based on average estimated walking time to the nearest bus, major grocery, and shopping centre:

* 10 minutes or less: green
* 15 minutes or less: blue
* 25 minutes or less: amber
* above 25 minutes: slate

Planned indicators are shown as placeholders and must not be treated as live data until dedicated sources are added:

* population density
* median rent / rent trend
* schools / childcare
* safety
* planned development

## Deferred Work

AI summaries, crime data, school quality, and rental price analysis are deferred. Map/list interactions, such as clicking a list item to focus the matching marker, are also deferred. On the auth side: email verification, password reset, and account settings are deferred.

## Architecture Refactoring

To improve maintainability, the bloated monolithic files (`app/page.tsx` and `app/api/places/route.ts`) have been refactored using component-based and service-layer patterns:
- **Shared code:** Extracted TypeScript interfaces to `app/lib/types.ts` and generic formatters to `app/lib/utils.ts`.
- **Frontend Components:** Split `app/page.tsx` into a layout orchestrator coordinating `SearchForm`, `ScoreBreakdown`, and `NearbyPlacesList`. Complex React state and search side-effects were extracted into `app/hooks/useLocationSearch.ts`.
- **Backend Services:** Separated API integration logic into dedicated services (`app/lib/services/googlePlaces.ts` and `app/lib/services/transitland.ts`), leaving `app/api/places/route.ts` responsible only for request coordination and score computation.

*Note on Transitland API Refactor Issue:* During the initial service extraction, an issue occurred where Transitland bus stops were returned without fetching their distinct route departures. This was quickly identified and patched by ensuring `fetchTransitlandBusDepartures` iterates over the sorted stops and attaches `transportServices` prior to returning to the places route.
